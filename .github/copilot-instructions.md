• Before implementing any code, ask 3 clarifying questions to make the requirements more complete
• Based on the user requirement, create a SPEC.MD to write a detailed specification and ask user for
comments
• Based on the updated requirement, create the code and ask the user for a comment.
• When the user provides feedback about the app, modify the SPEC.MD before making changes to the
code.
• Record in a file “LESSONS_LEARNT.MD” to record the user preference and mistakes you have made,
and how you can do better next time
